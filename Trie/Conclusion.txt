Using trie
- using more space to cost less time
- similar to hashMap(key-value), but tries's key only can be string.
- advantage: time complexity. Insertion & Search: O(length of key).
             Hash to calculate is O(length of key), also Hash could result in collisions.
             Trie has better search complexity than Hash because Trie is to reduce unneccesary comparation between strings.
- disadvantage: high space complexity.

Build trie
- can use array or dynamic pointer.


When to use trie?
- pre-matching
  i.e. google autofill your search strings.
- range checking
- to calculate and order amount of strings.
  i.e. how google calculates the high frequency searching words.

Template
- Each one is pretty similar, so could use either one
