DP characteristics: 

the current solution depends on the previous one.
repeated sub questions
the best sub question

Diff. v.s. D&C:

DC: sub question is independent, using recursion.
DP: sub question is related to each other, repeated, need to memorize, using iteration.



steps:
1. to find the formula: (VERY IMPORTANT)
   if(r==N) MaxSum(r,j) = D(r,j)
   else MaxSum(r,j) = Max{MaxSum(r+1,j), MaxSum(r+1,j+1) } + D(r,j)
2. memorization:
   the original question -> sub questions
   record each sub question's answer into [][]
   when the all sub questions get answers, the original one solved.
