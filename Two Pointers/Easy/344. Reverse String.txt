class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        if(s == null || s.length == 0) return;
        int begin = 0, end = s.length - 1;
        while(begin <= end){
            char c = s[begin];
            s[begin] = s[end];
            s[end] = c;
            begin++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}

some interview questions:


Use Java API or implement it low level?
Call reverse Java API?
+= between Strings in core loop (see, not all solutions are O(n) ;)
StringBuilder VS StringBuffer (synchronized)
Construct a StringBuilder from input and do mutating operations: charAt and setCharAt
Use toCharArray() and read from char[], or use String.charAt()
Do preallocate builder capacity or let it grow?
Use append(char) or setCharAt?
How to iterate?
loop based on input length
two pointers (start | end) or loop all items
start from front or back
while or for
while(true) or while(start < end) or while(start <= end)
cache length in for loop or query each time
recursion
+=
Collecting argument (char[] + index, StringBuilder)
Create a method for iteration or leave it inline?
shortcut for "", "x"?
specialize for "xy" and "xyz"?
What about null input?
How do you format your code?
