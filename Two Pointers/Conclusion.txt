- Swap: 344. Reverse String
- setup an index as foundamental, two pointers iterate the whole arrays: 15. 3Sum
- two pointers (fast and slow): 
  Using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm: 
  using two pointers: slow and fast, slow moves one step every time,
  fast moves two steps every time, if there's a cycle, slow must could be meet fast.
  If when slow reaches the end of the line and they have not met, which means there's
  no cycle. Why they will definitely meet? Because if you see the line as a circle, the
  fast moves towards the slow, so they will meet each other.
