1.sort two arrays, fill in the right spot in the new array.
2.find the right/worst element meets your requirement.

complexity:sort:O(nlogn) find the right order:O(n)

--------------
array cannot be sorted:



--------
both: use Math.max tracking.

----------
diff. btw DP v.s. Greedy:
DP:Looking from the end and at each point ahead checking the best possible way to reach the end
Greedy:Looking from the start and selecting the locally optimum in the hope of reaching global optimum

DO NOT OVERTHINKING
